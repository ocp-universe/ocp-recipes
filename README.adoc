Collection of OpenShift recipes to manage common/infrastructure workload

toc::[]

== Overview

Using GitOps to manage a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster with the cross-cutting capabilities like Pipeline, Secret Management or similar.
For the realization of the GitOps principles basically ArgoCD is used. In the current state the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cicd/gitops/gitops-release-notes.html[OpenShift GitOps] option is used, which integrates ArgoCD and Pipeline.

The idea of the solution to manage a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster in the GitOps way has the following pillars

* link:01-init[Init]: which installs the minium tools to support GitOps, here ArgoCD using the `Red Hat OpenShift GitOps`
* link:02-cluster-config[Cluster Config]: The ArgoCD project and app which will manage the cluster and maintain the capabilities. Here is the list of wanted capabilities defined - the descriptive state of your cluster.
* link:03-cluster-capabilities[Cluster Capabilities]: All the possible (cross-cutting) capabilities. Usually this is an own repository and not project specific.

Figure <<figure1>> visualize the relation between the repositories and configuration artifacts.

== Installation

Configure the `cluster-config.json' in link:02-cluster-config[Cluster Config] to select the desired state (and capabilities). Some capability examples are in link:03-cluster-capabilities[Cluster Capabilities], any other repository is how ever possible.

Follow the instruction in link:01-init[Init] to install the foundation (ArgoCD and the bootstrap config).

== Summary

GitOps approach also for maintaining Kubernetes Clusters. Reusability. Idempotent results.
